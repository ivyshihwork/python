The Classic Snake Game
=======================

This is written according to the classic design of the game.

In the game it starts with a snake and the food on the board.
Use controls (arrow keys: left, right, up and down) to move around to consume the food.

Once the food is consumed, a new one will appear on the board, the snake body will grow.  The game ends when the snake collides into its own body or the borders.


Dependencies of the python packages: Turtle, Screen

Purpose of writing this game:  for fun and to demonstrate python coding in graphics libraries, OOP concepts and usages.  

Non-OOP version: src/og.py
OOP version: src/[food.py, main.py, scoreboard.py, snake.py]
