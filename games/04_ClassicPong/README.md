Classic Pong Game
=================

This is a classic version of Pong game.

The game starts with split screen with score on top and 2 paddles on the side.

Once the game starts, both players can use keys to move the paddle up and down to bounce the ball back and forth.  Right side player can use arrow up and down; left side of player can use w to go up and s to go down.

Each time the ball hits the paddle it speeds up slightly until a player misses it and the speed is reset.

One point will be rewarded to opponent if one side fails to catch the ball.

The game ends when first player gets 5 points.

Dependencies of the python packages: turtle, time

Purpose of writing this game:  for fun and to demonstrate more advanced usage of the same graphics library.  

Enjoy!
