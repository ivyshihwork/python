This password manager has a graphical UI to keep track and generate password for different websites.

The information will be stored in password_info.json locally to this python program.

Once 'Generate password' button is clicked, it will also copy the password to the clipboard to be used.

Search function is based on the website name and is case insensitive.
Once a record on file is found, all the fields will be populated to that record.

* Python 3
  * module tkinter

To run:
