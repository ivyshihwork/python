Blogger
=======


Welcome to Blogger!

This was developed using Docker, PostgresSQL, PGAdmin, Python, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, and Flask in vscode. API tested using Insomnia.

The design is simple.  It mainly contains user, blog, posts and comments.  
User can:
1. create account, blog, post, comment
2. Follow blogs

Blogger/requirements.txt =>  all of the python modules used, and a few more for experimentations that haven't been added to this repo.
Blogger/projectEndPoints.docx => all the API endpoints available
Blogger/flask/Generated_ERD_pgadmin.PNG =>  Simple ERD diagram generated by PGAdmin
Blogger/flask/blogger.sql => SQL file used to create the database, passed through docker images.  
Blogger/flask/seed.py => python code to generate all the sample data to populate the database
Blogger/flask/Blogger_pgdump.sql => pgdump.sql for the database that includes sample data
Blogger/flask/Insomnia_2021-10-23.json => the API end point testing done in Insomnia
Blogger/flask/blogger/src => source code for model and implementations
