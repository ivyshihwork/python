Classic Pong Game
=================

This is a classic version of Pong game.

The game starts with split screen with score on top and 2 paddles on the side.

Once the game starts, both players can use keys to move the paddle up and down to bounce the ball back and forth.

One point will be rewarded to opponent if one side fails to catch the ball.


Dependencies of the python packages: turtle
