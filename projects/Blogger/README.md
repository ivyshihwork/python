Blogger
=======


Welcome to Blogger!

This was developed using Docker, PostgresSQL, PGAdmin, Python, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, and Flask in vscode. API tested using Insomnia.

The design is simple.  It mainly contains user, blog, posts and comments.  
User can:
1. Create/fetch/update/delete account, blog, post, comment
2. Follow/unfollow blogs

Blogger/requirements.txt =>  all of the python modules used, and a few more for experimentations that haven't been added to this repo. <br>
Blogger/projectEndPoints.docx => all the API endpoints available<br>
Blogger/flask/Generated_ERD_pgadmin.PNG =>  Simple ERD diagram generated by PGAdmin<br>
Blogger/flask/blogger.sql => SQL file used to create the database, passed through docker images.  <br>
Blogger/flask/seed.py => python code to generate all the sample data to populate the database<br>
Blogger/flask/Blogger_pgdump.sql => pgdump.sql for the database that includes sample data<br>
Blogger/flask/Insomnia_2021-10-23.json => the API end point testing done in Insomnia<br>
Blogger/flask/blogger/src => source code for model and implementations<br>

p.s. Like/unlike, comment on top of comments were not added intentionally.  They have been popular with Facebook but it causes a lot drama on social media!
This is more for information sharing and reading.
