Turtle Crossing Road Game
=========================

Welcome to my version of Turtle Crossing Road game.  

Game starts with a window that has cars running from right to left the screen.
Player controls the turtle sitting on the bottom center of the screen.
Use arrow up, down, left, and right keys to move the turtle to dodge the cars and make it to the top.

Each time the turtle made to the top, the level goes up, and the car speed will increase.

Game is over when the turtle got hit by car or the turtle has been moved out of the screen on the right/left side.


This is the final python small project on Turtle library that combines all knowledge used on all previous coded game based on Turtle library.

Hope you enjoy it!
