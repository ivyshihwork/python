Flashy
======

Welcome to Flashy - a flash card learning program.

It takes a CSV file (e.g., data/french_words.csv).
First column is things to learn, and second column is the back of the card where the answer is.

The program starts randomly through the deck, and 3 seconds it will flip to the back for answer.

If it's something you already know, hit check button to remove it from list to learn to go on next card.  If not, hit X button and it'll keep this card in deck.

Next time it will load modified list (data/words_to_learn.csv) and continue.

Hope this will help.
