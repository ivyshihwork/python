US State Name Guessing Game
===========================

When the game starts, a pop-up window will be displayed asking for any US state name.
Enter a state name and click ok.  

If a state name is guessed correctly, the name will be displayed on the map.

If that's all player can remember, enter 'exit' in the box, and the game will exit.
A CSV file called "states_to_learn.csv" will be created.
It will contain the rest of the US states that were not guessed correctly.

This is written based on Turtle ad Pandas library.

I hope you will enjoy it.
