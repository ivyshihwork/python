Productivity Tools
==================

Here is a list of applications I have created using python.
The list will get updated as time goes by.  
Feel free to keep coming back and check them anytime!

Please note the library dependencies for the individual apps.
In order for the app to work, the library must be installed prior to execution of the code.

Any suggestion / feedback is welcomed!
